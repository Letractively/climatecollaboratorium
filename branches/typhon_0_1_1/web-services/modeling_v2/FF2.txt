reviewer,

    1.1.1:
    bruce_zhang: 
    a context.xml is added to disable the session persistent to avoid data context persistence instead of
    possible manual work folder delete.
    please do "ant undeploy deploy" to verify.    
    
    2.2.3:
    squarY: ok. although these are out of scope but I still remove those imports. 
    
    2.2.9
    bruce_zhang: final reviewer, COULD YOU LOOK AT PM comment on score change: at:
    http://software.topcoder.com/review/actions/ViewReview.do?method=viewReview&rid=84121    
    Manager Comment:   Based on the forum question and the response from the contest owner this approach is acceptable.  Raising to 4. 
    
    murphydog: fixed.
    
    3.1.1
    bruce_zhang: PLEASE check line 165-175 already in last FF ...
    
    4.1.1
    bruce_zhang: please see PM comment as well: not needed.
    Manager Comment:   Since a change log is not a required deliverable and the deploy guide is complete, this is being raised to a 4. 
    
    murphy_dog: Did you look at the chane in last FF?
    
Thx
