#summary Instructions on setting up your development environment.

The Climate Collaboratorium is based upon v.5.2.3 of the [http://liferay.com Liferay web-portal].  It has been developed against Tomcat 6.1 and MySql 5.1  We recommend the following steps to getting your environment up and running.

==Basic Preparation ==

We have not yet build any re-distributable wars for the collaboratorium, so it will be necessary to deploy your own from the "ext" environment.  Instructions on setting up the ext environment may be found in the Liferay developer docs.
