**Goal**

The goal of the [Climate Collaboratorium](http://climatecollaboratorium.org) project is to harness the collective intelligence of thousands of people around the world to address one of the most important problems confronting humanity today: global climate change. Inspired by systems like Wikipedia and Linux, the project is developing a global, on-line forum in which people can create, analyze, and ultimately select detailed plans for what we humans can do about global climate change.

The [Climate Collaboratorium](http://climatecollaboratorium.org) is a project of the [MIT Center for Collective Intelligence](http://cci.mit.edu).

**How it works**

_The technology remains work in progress.  We do not claim to have the solution, but we believe that we're asking the right questions._

Currently, the core of the collaboratorium is an evolving collection of user-created plans based on the actions humans can take. For instance, the actions in the current plans include reducing greenhouse gas emissions by various amounts.

Plans are supported by computational models that users can run to predict the impacts of their plans. For example, models can be used to predict concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, temperature changes, and economic costs given a certain proposed reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

Users can review and offer contributions to debates about cross cutting issues, which are presented using an argument formalism. Users can also vote on various arguments and positions within debates.  There is only a loose coupling between debates and plans right now, but this may be modified in the future.

Finally, users vote upon plans to select the best ones based on available information.  We anticipate that many types of plans will ultimately be created.


**Possible outcomes**

At a minimum, we hope that this on-line forum will help educate the general public about the real issues involved in global climate change.

More importantly, by constructively engaging a broad range of scientists, policy makers, business people, and interested citizens, this forum may help develop plans and policies that are actually better than any that would have otherwise been developed.

If the project is successful in its grandest ambitions, it will lead to the creation in a few years of a societal institution that is comparable to (though perhaps somewhat smaller than) Wikipedia. It will be an on-line community used routinely by scientists, politicians, journalists, and anyone with a professional interest in climate change. It will also be a standard resource for educators, students, and any citizens who want to learn about climate change. And it will be a place where any citizens who care can either express their opinions about climate change directly, or delegate their "proxy" to others who will vote on their behalf.

In short, it could become a combination of an on-line simulation game for climate change, a kind of Wikipedia for controversial topics, and a form of electronic democracy on steroids.
